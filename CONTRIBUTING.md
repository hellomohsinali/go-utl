# Junie Guidelines for Go Code Documentation

## Overview
These guidelines ensure that all Go code in this project is thoroughly documented with detailed comments that are helpful for developers who are new to the Go language.

## General Principles
- Write comments assuming the reader has no prior experience with Go
- Explain not just what the code does, but why and how it works
- Use clear, simple language and use jargon (but explain in simple language as well) when possible
- Document every package, function, method, and complex code block
